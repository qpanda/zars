* maybe float multiple http://css.maxdesign.com.au/floatutorial/introduction10.htm allows me to display user in front of menu? otherwise deactivated menu item?
* EL expression in f:view should also default to request context if localeController.activeLocale is null
* business logic
	* check that user assigned to GroupReservation has role accountant
	* mark Invoice and Report invalid if associated GroupReservation is changed
* error handling
	* duplicated user/email not handled yet in AddUserController.create() and UserService.createUser()
