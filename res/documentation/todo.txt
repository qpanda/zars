PENDING FIXES/DECISIONS
	o non working delete link in calendar popup
	o fix issue with export current table content and then export all table content fails
	o is security:intercept-url the correct approach to deny acess to admin pages for regular users?

MUST-HAVE
	o PDF export in addition to Excel export
	o test multiple users/sessions
		o test same user logged in multiple times
		o test login with user a, do not logoff, login with user b
		o test multiple users at the same time (same browser, different browser, different host)
	o rename Leistungsberechtiger to Benutzer
	o sorting of reservation table does not work
	o error-page not working in tomcat
	o mysql constraing parsing most likely broken with version on hyperion	
	o complete add/edit/delete/overview group reservations (all TODOs)
	o review all forms to check length of input strings
	o username should not allow special characters
	o annotate all service methods with @Secured
	o scrollbar for oversized forms
	o footer	
	  
SHOULD-HAVE
	o use SSL for j_spring_security_check
	o use abstract controller UserController for AddUserController and EditUserController and others
	o EL expression in f:view should also default to request context if localeController.activeLocale is null
	o check that user assigned to GroupReservation has role accountant
	o mark Invoice and Report invalid if associated GroupReservation is changed
	o email notification
	o pre-calculate approximate amount during reservation
	o display creation/update time and user who added/updated reservation
	o pricing and other settings and an editor to modify those

NICE-TO-HAVE
	o generics based settings and preferences services and Dtos
	o rename *Bean to *Dto
	o autocomplete false for disabled fields 
	o forwarding from login page if already logged in (pretty faces)
	o consolidate Reservation.firstName and Reservation.lastName into a single field Reservation.guestName
	o provide autocomplete for Reservation.guestName
	o recalculate group reservations based on room inuse
	o delete button next to individual reservations to delete particular/specific one
	o could add/edit group reservation be implemented with a ui:repeat/forall?
	o instead of read-only fields i could use invisible fields with a binding?
