SHOULD-HAVE
	o use abstract controller UserController for AddUserController and EditUserController and others
	o EL expression in f:view should also default to request context if localeController.activeLocale is null
	o check that user assigned to GroupReservation has role accountant
	o mark Invoice and Report invalid if associated GroupReservation is changed
	o email notification
	o pre-calculate approximate amount during reservation
	o display creation/update time and user who added/updated reservation
	o pricing and other settings and an editor to modify those

NICE-TO-HAVE
	o generics based settings and preferences services and Dtos
	o rename *Bean to *Dto
	o autocomplete false for disabled fields 
	o forwarding from login page if already logged in (pretty faces)
	o consolidate Reservation.firstName and Reservation.lastName into a single field Reservation.guestName
	o provide autocomplete for Reservation.guestName
	o recalculate group reservations based on room inuse
	o delete button next to individual reservations to delete particular/specific one
	o could add/edit group reservation be implemented with a ui:repeat/forall?
	o instead of read-only fields i could use invisible fields with a binding?
