MUST-HAVE
	o email notification
		o created/modified/locked account
		o admin reservations added/updated/deleted

SHOULD-HAVE
	o improve preferences
		o remove need for PreferenceBean: User.determinePreferredLocale, User.determinePreferredTimezone
		o UserBean includes preferences
		o use different Locale persistence value (en instead of English)
	o bundle multiple subsequent service calls into a single transactional service call, e.g.:
		transform
			savedUser = userService.createUser(username, password, emailAddress, firstName, lastName, determineSelectedRoleIds());
			savedTimezonePreference = preferenceService.createPreference(savedUser.getUserId(), PreferenceType.TIMEZONE, selectedTimezoneId);
			savedLocalePreference = preferenceService.createPreference(savedUser.getUserId(), PreferenceType.LOCALE, selectedLocaleDisplayName);
		to
			savedUserResponse = userService.createUser(username, password, emailAddress, firstName, lastName, determineSelectedRoleIds(), preferenceVoList);
	o use a manager layer to implement services like functionality without (1) security and (2) DTO mapping for re-use in service layer
	o use aspect for all @Async methods for excpetion handling
	o convert empty strings to null before persist
	o fiter setting error messages for admingroupreservation and listevent
	o fix ie and google chrome issues
		o revise floating layout (use clearfix?)
		o change menubar to menubutton(s) and commandbutton(s)?
		o jumping table in ie on admingroupreservation
	o pricing and other settings and an editor to modify those
	o improve DB creation/startup check to allow securing all methods, move service implementations to DAO layer!
	o pre-calculate approximate amount during reservation
	o highlight calendar text as non-editable?	
	o scrollbar for oversized forms
	o use SSL
	o use abstract controller UserController for AddUserController and EditUserController and others
	o EL expression in f:view should also default to request context if localeController.activeLocale is null
	o check that user assigned to GroupReservation has role accountant
	o mark Invoice and Report invalid if associated GroupReservation is changed

NICE-TO-HAVE
	o generics based settings and preferences services and Dtos
	o rename *Bean to *Dto
	o autocomplete false for disabled fields 
	o forwarding from login page if already logged in (pretty faces)
	o consolidate Reservation.firstName and Reservation.lastName into a single field Reservation.guestName
	o provide autocomplete for Reservation.guestName
	o recalculate group reservations based on room inuse
	o delete button next to individual reservations to delete particular/specific one
	o could add/edit group reservation be implemented with a ui:repeat/forall?
	o instead of read-only fields i could use invisible fields with a binding?
