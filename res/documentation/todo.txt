PENDING FIXES/DECISIONS
	o non working delete link in calendar popup
	o google chrome issues

MUST-HAVE
	o test multiple users/sessions
		o test multiple users at the same time (same browser, different browser, different host)
	o complete add/edit/delete/overview group reservations (all TODOs)
	o rename Leistungsberechtiger to Benutzer
	o help/about pages
	  
SHOULD-HAVE
	o email notification
	o display creation/update time and user who added/updated reservation
	o pricing and other settings and an editor to modify those
	o improve DB creation/startup check to allow securing all methods, move service implementations to DAO layer!
	o change menubar to menubutton(s) and commandbutton(s)?
	o pre-calculate approximate amount during reservation
	o revise floating layout (use clearfix?)
	o highlight calendar text as non-editable?	
	o scrollbar for oversized forms
	o jumping table in ie on admingroupreservation
	o use SSL for j_spring_security_check
	o use abstract controller UserController for AddUserController and EditUserController and others
	o EL expression in f:view should also default to request context if localeController.activeLocale is null
	o check that user assigned to GroupReservation has role accountant
	o mark Invoice and Report invalid if associated GroupReservation is changed

NICE-TO-HAVE
	o generics based settings and preferences services and Dtos
	o rename *Bean to *Dto
	o autocomplete false for disabled fields 
	o forwarding from login page if already logged in (pretty faces)
	o consolidate Reservation.firstName and Reservation.lastName into a single field Reservation.guestName
	o provide autocomplete for Reservation.guestName
	o recalculate group reservations based on room inuse
	o delete button next to individual reservations to delete particular/specific one
	o could add/edit group reservation be implemented with a ui:repeat/forall?
	o instead of read-only fields i could use invisible fields with a binding?
